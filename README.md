# mc-summary
HSLU MC course summary written in latex

## Build

Needs to have a latex compiler installed. I have used
[MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download). Make is just a workaround
for calling `pdflatex mc.tex`, which will build the pdf.

## Contribution

Just make a pull request, any changes are welcome.
